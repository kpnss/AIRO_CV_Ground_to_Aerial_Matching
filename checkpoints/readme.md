## 📚 Usage

The usage depends on the framework on which you are working. Since I used google Colab I found it easier to mount my drive and work there. 
Training and inference files are all based on this framework. 
If working on Colab my suggestion is to copy the files on your drive and find them using "/content/drive/MyDrive/name_of_checkpoint_file".
